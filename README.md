# ft_ls
ft_ls - This project is a recreation of the command ls that lists all the functions in a directory

# Introduction
The ls command is one of the first commands you have learned to use with shell. It is
also one you are using the most. Perhaps you have already asked yourself how is this
function coded? Thanks to this project, you will soon find out.

To Recode ls and some of its options will allow you to find out how to interact with
the file system using C. After all, you already know how to open, read, write and close a
file. But, what about the directories? Special files? Rights, dates or sizes of the files?

And while I am on the topic, the quality of your libft will make the difference
between a pleasant project experience and an abominable one. For example, if you add
ft_printf to your libft, your life will be more enjoyable. It is possible to complete the
ft_ls project without the ft_printf function. 

# Objectives
The project ft_ls opens the path to the Unix branch of the sphere system. For the first
time, you will have to face the one libc functions that will allow you to do other things
than just read or write on a file descriptor (this is to simplify of course). You will discover
a sub-system of functions of operating system’s API, the associated data structures, as
well as the management of memory allocation and the associated data.

# Mandatory part
• You must recode the system’s command ls.
• Its behavior must be identical to the original ls command with the following variations:
◦ Amongst the numerous options available, we are asking you to create the
following: -l, -R, -a, -r and -t.
◦ We strongly recommend that you account for the implications of the
option -R from the very beginning of your code...
◦ You do not have to deal with the multiple column format for the exit when
the option -l isn’t in the arguments.

# HOW TO USE
• Run the Makefile, e.g make, cMake etc
• Call ft_ls as by invoking this call './ft_ls'
• Append any flags that you may desire (see below for more), e.g ./ft_ls -Rl

# SUPPORTED FLAGS
-A - Shows all files (including hidden files), but doesn't show the "."
		and ".." directories. (Bonus)
*	-G - Shows normal files, but adds colour. (Bonus) **
**	-R - Shows all files recursively.
**	-a - Shows all files including "." and "..".
**	-f - Shows normal files, unsorted. (Bonus)	**
**	-l - Shows files in long format.
**	-n - Shows UID and GID in long format as a number. (Bonus) **
**	-p - Adds a '/' to the back of directory names. (Bonus)	**
**	-r - Reverses the output.
**	-t - Sorts files according to time.
